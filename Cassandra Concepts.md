## Cassandra concepts

## History
Cassandra is a wide column distributed database, its originated from Facebook and later contributed to Apache open source.  It is distributed wide column database. 

## Salient points
1. **Problem statement** - How can we have  reliable distributed database holding big data, which may not be as consistent but available and partition tolerant. 
2. **Distributed database holding big data** - Big data is data too large for a single server. The issue how can we make database divided into two or more parts each on its own server having different network, yet the database behaves as a single database. 

## Concepts 
1. **Node** - A single Cassandra instance, this is on a machine. This may be on a separate  network and may contain other nodes. The network can be geographically separated, altogether in a separate data center.
